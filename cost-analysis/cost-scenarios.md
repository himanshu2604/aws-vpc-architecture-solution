# AWS VPC Cost Analysis - Deployment Scenarios

## ðŸ’° Current Architecture Cost: $96.10/month

### Core Components
- **NAT Gateway**: $45.00 (47% of total cost)
- **EC2 Instances**: $51.10 (53% of total cost)
- **Networking**: Free (VPC, IGW, Peering)

## ðŸ“Š Alternative Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Cost-Optimized (Development Focus)
**Monthly Cost: $51.10** (-47% savings)

**Changes:**
- Remove NAT Gateway
- Use NAT Instance (t3.nano) instead: $5.00/month
- Keep all other components

**Trade-offs:**
- Reduced availability (single point of failure)
- Manual management required
- Lower bandwidth capacity

### Scenario 2: High Availability 
**Monthly Cost: $141.10** (+47% increase)

**Changes:**
- Add second NAT Gateway in different AZ: +$45.00
- Upgrade to t3.small instances: +$36.00
- Add Application Load Balancer: +$16.20

**Benefits:**
- Multi-AZ redundancy
- Better performance
- Load distribution

### Scenario 3: Production-Only
**Monthly Cost: $81.50** (-15% savings)

**Changes:**
- Remove Development VPC entirely
- Keep only Production environment

**Use Case:**
- Single environment deployment
- Simplified management

## ðŸŽ¯ Cost Optimization Recommendations

### Immediate Savings (0-30 days)
1. **Reserved Instances**: Save 30-60% on EC2 costs
   - 1-year term: ~$30/month savings
   - 3-year term: ~$35/month savings

2. **Spot Instances for Dev**: Save 70-90% on development instances
   - Dev instances: $14.60 â†’ $2.00/month

### Medium-term Savings (30-90 days)
1. **Right-sizing**: Monitor and optimize instance types
   - Potential 20-30% reduction if oversized

2. **Scheduled Scaling**: Stop dev instances during off-hours
   - 50% savings on dev environment: $7.30/month

### Long-term Optimization (90+ days)
1. **Serverless Migration**: Move to Lambda/Fargate where applicable
   - Could reduce compute costs by 40-60%

2. **Reserved Capacity**: NAT Gateway reserved pricing (when available)
   - Potential 20-30% savings on NAT Gateway costs

## ðŸ“ˆ Scaling Cost Projections

### 2x Scale (14 instances)
- **Monthly Cost**: $147.20
- **Cost per instance**: $7.30 (same efficiency)

### 5x Scale (35 instances)
- **Monthly Cost**: $300.50
- **Additional NAT Gateways**: +$90 (2 more)
- **Load Balancers**: +$32.40 (2 ALBs)

### 10x Scale (70 instances)
- **Monthly Cost**: $631.00
- **Multiple AZ NAT**: +$180 (4 total)
- **Enterprise features needed**: +$200-500

## ðŸ’¡ Key Cost Insights

### Biggest Cost Drivers
1. **NAT Gateway**: Fixed cost regardless of usage
2. **Cross-AZ traffic**: Can add up with high data transfer
3. **Instance sprawl**: Easy to over-provision

### Hidden Costs to Monitor
- Data transfer charges (especially cross-region)
- EBS storage and snapshots
- CloudWatch logs and metrics
- Security services (GuardDuty, WAF)

### Free Tier Benefits
- VPC components (VPC, IGW, Route Tables, Security Groups)
- First 1GB of data transfer out
- Basic CloudWatch metrics
- VPC Flow Logs (first 5GB)

---

**Bottom Line**: Current architecture is well-optimized for the requirements. The single NAT Gateway approach saves $45/month while meeting the case study needs. Consider Reserved Instances for immediate 30-60% savings on compute costs.
