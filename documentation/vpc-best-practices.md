## 🏗️ Network Design Best Practices

### CIDR Block Planning

#### ✅ Best Practices
```
📊 CIDR Sizing Recommendations:
- Production VPC: /16 (65,536 IPs) - Large scale environments
- Development VPC: /20 (4,096 IPs) - Medium scale environments  
- Testing VPC: /24 (256 IPs) - Small scale environments

Example CIDR Allocation:
- Production: 10.0.0.0/16
- Staging: 10.1.0.0/20
- Development: 10.2.0.0/20
- Testing: 10.3.0.0/24
```

#### ❌ Common Pitfalls
- Using overlapping CIDR blocks
- Choosing CIDR blocks too small for future growth
- Not planning for VPC peering or VPN connections

### Subnet Design Strategy

#### 🏢 Multi-Tier Architecture
```
📍 Recommended Subnet Layout:
┌─────────────────────────────────┐
│           Public Subnets         │
│  Web Tier (10.0.1.0/24)        │
│  - ALB/NLB                      │
│  - NAT Gateway                  │
│  - Bastion Hosts               │
└─────────────────────────────────┘

┌─────────────────────────────────┐
│          Private Subnets         │
│  App Tier (10.0.2.0/24)        │
│  - Application Servers          │
│  - Auto Scaling Groups          │
└─────────────────────────────────┘

┌─────────────────────────────────┐
│         Database Subnets         │
│  DB Tier (10.0.3.0/24)         │
│  - RDS instances                │
│  - ElastiCache                  │
│  - Database replicas            │
└─────────────────────────────────┘
```

#### 🌎 Multi-AZ Deployment
```
✅ High Availability Strategy:
AZ-A Subnets:
- Public: 10.0.1.0/24
- Private: 10.0.2.0/24  
- DB: 10.0.3.0/24

AZ-B Subnets:
- Public: 10.0.11.0/24
- Private: 10.0.12.0/24
- DB: 10.0.13.0/24

AZ-C Subnets:
- Public: 10.0.21.0/24
- Private: 10.0.22.0/24
- DB: 10.0.23.0/24
```

### Route Table Optimization

#### 🛣️ Route Table Best Practices
- **Minimize Route Tables**: Use shared route tables where possible
- **Specific Routes**: Most specific routes take precedence
- **Default Routes**: Use 0.0.0.0/0 for default internet routing
- **Peering Routes**: Use specific CIDR blocks for VPC peering

```bash
✅ Optimized Route Table Structure:
1. Public Route Table
   - Local: 10.0.0.0/16
   - Internet: 0.0.0.0/0 → IGW

2. Private Route Table (NAT)
   - Local: 10.0.0.0/16
   - Internet: 0.0.0.0/0 → NAT Gateway
   - Peering: 10.1.0.0/16 → PCX

3. Database Route Table (Isolated)
   - Local: 10.0.0.0/16
   - Peering: 10.1.0.0/16 → PCX
```

## 🔒 Security Best Practices

### Security Groups Configuration

#### 🛡️ Layered Security Approach
```
🔐 Security Group Hierarchy:
1. Web Tier Security Group
   ├── Inbound: 80/443 from 0.0.0.0/0
   ├── Inbound: 22 from Admin-SG
   └── Outbound: All traffic

2. App Tier Security Group
   ├── Inbound: 8080 from Web-SG
   ├── Inbound: 22 from Bastion-SG
   └── Outbound: All traffic

3. Database Security Group
   ├── Inbound: 3306 from App-SG
   ├── Inbound: 22 from Bastion-SG
   └── Outbound: None (restrictive)
```

#### 🎯 Security Group Best Practices
- **Principle of Least Privilege**: Grant minimum required access
- **Use Security Group References**: Reference other SGs instead of IP ranges
- **Regular Audits**: Review and clean up unused security groups
- **Descriptive Names**: Use clear naming conventions
- **Port-Specific Rules**: Avoid opening wide port ranges

### Network Access Control Lists (NACLs)

#### 🚧 NACL Implementation Strategy
```
📋 NACL Rules Best Practices:
- Subnet-Level Protection: Additional layer beyond security groups
- Stateless Rules: Define both inbound and outbound rules
- Rule Numbers: Use increments of 100 for easy insertion
- Default Deny: Explicit deny at the end of rule list

Example NACL Rules:
Rule # | Type     | Protocol | Port  | Source/Dest    | Allow/Deny
100    | Inbound  | HTTP     | 80    | 0.0.0.0/0      | Allow
200    | Inbound  | HTTPS    | 443   | 0.0.0.0/0      | Allow
300    | Inbound  | SSH      | 22    | 10.0.0.0/8     | Allow
*      | Inbound  | All      | All   | 0.0.0.0/0      | Deny
```

### VPC Flow Logs

#### 📊 Comprehensive Logging Strategy
```bash
✅ Flow Logs Configuration:
- Level: VPC, Subnet, and ENI levels
- Destination: CloudWatch Logs or S3
- Format: Custom format with required fields
- Retention: Based on compliance requirements

Key Fields to Monitor:
- Source/Destination IPs
- Source/Destination Ports
- Protocol
- Action (ACCEPT/REJECT)
- Bytes transferred
```
